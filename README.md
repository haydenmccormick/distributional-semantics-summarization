# distributional-semantics-summarization
This is our final project for computational semantics. We follow the approach
taken in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2019.112958) in order to
generate summaries of text documents using word embeddings.

Install Python 3.10, create a virtual environment, then run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run experiment (fairly resource intensive),
```
python src/main.py
```

To graph results,
```
python src/visualize.py (1/2/l)
```
